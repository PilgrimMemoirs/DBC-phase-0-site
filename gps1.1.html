	           <h2> What is pair programming?</h2>
	                <p> The process of collaborating with another developer to work as a team to provide programming solutions. </p>
	                
	           <h2> Why is pair programming important to DBC?  </h2>
	                <p> DBC wasn't designed to pump out codemonkeys. Instead, the program gears towards generating well-rounded coders who not only have an adept knowledge of what they're working on but who also understand the give-and-take involved in being in a collaborative, project-based environment.</p>
	                
	           <h2> Compare Driver and Navigator </h2>
	            <p> If the Navigator is the guy holding the map, the Driver is the one making the turns. While the former guides his partner through the goals the code is working towards accomplishing, the latter is responsible for implementing them.</p>
	            
                
                <h2> My Reflection</h2>
	            <p> I really enjoy the pairing process, I feel assignments go much quicker with both minds working together to come up with a solution. With coding being fairly complicated and expanse, it was nice to pair and to learn from my partner in areas I didn't know much about. Pairing also affirmed my skills, we'd compare how we usually approach a situation and it was relieving to hear when my suggestions were confirmed to be the best way to tackle the situation. </p>
