		<h3> When, Why & How to Classes in Ruby</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
Sometimes in ruby you'll have multiple objects that require the same actions(methods), that's where using a class comes handy. Especially when those similiar objects start reaching large large quantities, you'll want a way  to automate thier actions.
In the example below I created a class that takes a farm animal and the quanity of that animal as it's initial input to find out how much food and housing you'll need for all your animals. 


	<h3> Example</h3>
	<p>
	<p>
	<blockquote>
    class FarmAnimal  #Define the Class. Class names use CamelCase
    	<p>
	<p>def initialize(quantity)     #An initialize method. Will expect 1 argument, in this case the quantity of that particular farm animal
	<p> @quanity=quantity		#The argument is turned into an instance variable so it can be used throughout the class. An @ before the name of the variable makes it an instance variable.
	<p>end
	<p><p>
    <p>def needs		#This will be the method you call to find out what you need for each breed of animal. It calls instance varibles set below.
        <p>p @stays
        <p>p @eats
    <p>end
    <p>
<p>    
<p>	def eats(food, amount_per_day)		#A method to calculate how much food you'll need per day for each breed. Gives output string sentence saying exactly what you need.
<p>	 amount_of = @quanity * amount_per_day
<p>	@eats ="You need #{amount_of} #{food} per day."
<p>	end
<p>	
<p>	
<p>	def stays(housing, acre) 	#A method to calculate how many acres of the kind of housing you'll need for each breed. Gives output string sentence saying exactly what you need.
<p>	  amount_of = @quanity * acre
   <p>   @stays ="You need #{amount_of} acres of #{housing}."
<p>	end
   <p> 
    <p>
<p>	end
<p>	
<p>	chicken = FarmAnimal.new(10)		
<p>	chicken.eats("cups of pellets", 0.5)
   <p> chicken.stays("range", 0.25)
<p>	
<p>	cow = FarmAnimal.new(5)
<p>	cow.eats("bales of hay",2.5)
<p>	cow.stays("pasture",1)
   <p> 
<p>    pig = FarmAnimal.new(3)
<p>    pig.eats("buckets of slop", 2)
   <p> pig.stays("pig pen", 0.5)
<p>    
<p>    
<p>    p pig.needs
<p>    p chicken.needs
<p>    p cow.needs
<p>
