	  <p dir="ltr">NoSQL was developed in the 90&rsquo;s to meet a new demand for databases - to allow more flexibility and store larger amounts of data that can be be efficiently accessed on a more frequent scale AND(!) with less downtime when the inevitable changes come along. While it has made claims to be the DB(database) way of the future, there are still many developers that are holding tight on to their SQL (technically referring to relational databases here, but I&rsquo;m sticking to SQL for convenience in this post). <br>
	    <br>
	    Why hasn&rsquo;t this miracle solution of NoSQL taken over? The likes of Google and Amazon have adopted it so it must be the best, yeah? Well, kinda. In my impressive &nbsp;hour and a half of research, I discovered that NoSQL can be a really brilliant solution for many modern day applications, however, it still doesn&rsquo;t have the stability and support that SQL databases have. </strong></p>
	  <p><br>
      </p>
	  <p>A general rule I&rsquo;m going to adopt for myself is to determine the best solution based on the requirements of the database before I start making it. When it comes to smaller-scale projects that hold very important information, I&rsquo;ll lean towards the traditional route of SQL. If I have a very large database that will likely have a high access demand, NoSQL it&rsquo;ll be. Of course that&rsquo;s very broad, but It&rsquo;ll be a good, initial base to work from. </strong></p>
	  <p><br>
	    I am actually excited to learn both and to keep my options open depending on the nature of what I&rsquo;m working on. Both are still around for a reason, NoSQL definitely sounds like the most attractive option and potential way of the future -but there is a reason why SQL hasn&rsquo;t totally been ruled out.
