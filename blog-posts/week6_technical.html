	<article>	<p>	Object-oriented design was introduced to make the process of coding more relatable to real-life situations by integrating code with data. By revolving code around the idea that everything is an object, it is easier to apply the characteristics and actions to those objects. Using OOD (object-oriented design) can also be highly more organized and efficient by using classes to create multiple objects with similar characteristics and actions.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h3> Example</h3>
	  <p> For example a Dog (an object) has it’s own characteristics it’s breed, it’s age, it’s gender ect.. These are known as the object’s attributes or state -  the code’s data. It also has it’s own actions; wags tail, runs, takes naps. Those are it’s methods, the code’s procedures. 
      </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h3>Defining Objects
      </h3>
	  <p>Typically, before even thinking about writing code, you will need to work through the problem at hand and making userstories. From there, determine what is the object, the attributes and the actions. A good rule of thumb is that objects are nouns, if you can put “the” in front of it, then it should be an object, ex: The car, the customer, the bank account.
	    
      From there, using the userstories you can organize what attributes that object will have by pulling out the adjectives. Lastly, use the verbs of the userstories to determine the actions these objects will need.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h3> Setting up Classes
      Classes </h3>
	  <p>are what box an object’s attributes and methods together. Not only can it box those up, but it can also be applied to more than one object, streamlining the creation of many objects of the same nature. Subclasses can be made if there are some similarities with another class (which in turn would be the parent class). Subclasses will inherit the methods and attributes from the parent, but can be rewritten. 
	    
	    It’s within the organization of these classes that can make or break the goals of well-structured OOD code, especially with data being passed around and in between many different methods.
      </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h3>The concluding difference
      </h3>
	  <p>The ultimate goal of a finished program is that it when the time comes to change it, which is inevitable, that the code will be easy to understand and workable to change with few complications. Taking the time to organize well structured code that can easily be changed is far more efficient than quickly doing up code that works well for it’s present intention. 
	    
	    OOD has the potential to do that - not necessarily because of the object definitions, but its how you compose them with APIE (abstraction, … and encapsulation). Objects are given lifecycles throughout the program that, depending on how they’re organzied, can actually work against you when it come to making future changes. 
	    
	    With functional, less data is stored for later use. This can make it easier to rework since there is not as much back-tracking.  The criticism with functional is that slowdown can happen with it’s less efficient use of memory.
      </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h3>In a nutshell	    </h3>
	  <p>OOD tends to be more practical for creating commercial web applications, while functional is more prefered in academia. Other seasoned programmers would argue that a combination of both is the way to go.
	    
	    A rule I’m making for myself, as I continue learning Ruby, is to direct my focus on learning how to create efficient, reworkable, readable code as much as possible with OOD, but being able to recognize when to substitute with a functional approach. Below is a solid resource I found to demonstrate good use of functional design in Ruby.	    </p>
