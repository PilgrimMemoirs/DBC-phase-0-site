		<h3> The Pro's and Con's behind </h3>
		<h3>the Language of the Web</h3>
		<br><br>
        <p> Why is JavaScript popular in web development?<br>
JavaScript’s popularity is almost a forced one, with it doning the title of “Language of the Web”. Looking back at it’s history, it started to succeed after the fall of Java and when Netscape, the dominant browser at the time, developed and launched the language in the mid 90’s. It’s timing was perfect for other browsers to pick-up. Since then it has had blazing popularity for it’s relative ease of being able to learn and it being accessible across all major browsers. <br>
<br>
What are the great things about JavaScript? <br>
On the user end, It makes otherwise stagnant sites come alive with interactivity and user function. Filling out forms, online shopping and playing games have all become more responsive and intereactive. This makes for more enjoyable and effortless web browsing. On the developer end, JavaScript is great because all you need a browser and text editor to program - both of which come standard on pcs. <br>
<br>
What are its limitations? <br>
It is my (inexperienced) impression that JavaScript gets it’s bad rep from seasoned programmers who simply prefer other (non-web) programming languages and hold a grudge over JS basically being the only option when it comes to developing for the web. I look forward to coming back to the former statement after I become more experienced with web development to see if I feel the same way. That being said, in my short time of learning JavaScript so far, I have been hurdled many warnings about how to approach my JS programming.<br>
<br>
There are other still plenty of complaints over the language, even from JS fans. The most prominent warning I am experiencing while learning the language is that errors can be easy to make and incredibly hard to find. When it was released with Netscape it’s popularity exploded at such a rate that removing imperfections from the language became impossible without existing code being broken. While the language has evolved, those early imperfections still hang around with vengeance. Of course this is a lot more to JavaScript in terms of pros and cons. <br>
<br>
What I have written here is what I have discovered in the last few weeks of learning and researching. In the weeks to come I hope to expand my knowledge and learn more about what makes this language have such a love/hate relationship amongst the developer community. <!-- Article Goes Here-->
