	  <p>I get pretty bogged down and unmotivated when dealing with a lot of repetitive or more intense logical tasks, especially when the work is something I’m not particularly interested in or see little meaning behind. I think it’s good to address this early on, especially since web development has a wide spectrum of tasks behind it.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> While there are many tasks that welcome creative solutions, I know not every day is going to involve them. The idea of full-days without them seem intimidating and draining. I know I’ll have to keep focus on the small tasks while remembering the big, more meaningful picture of what I’m working on. Doing so will help keep me optimistic and motivated. Also taking breaks will definitely be essential. To best get my mind off any tedious or difficult tasks I’m stuck on, embracing my other creative outlets will be beneficial. In general, I’m pretty good about living up to my values of embracing creativity and doing meaningful work in my personal life, however most jobs I worked were quite the opposite. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>While at DBC I plan on reminding myself to utilize breaks by going outside and taking long walks and, most importantly, taking photos. Photography has been a huge creative outlet for me for as long as I can remember and helps me take my mind off any difficult or stressful times. As far as relating my values to any stereotype threats I may encounter, I don’t see a huge connection. If anything, doing some of what I mentioned above may help me keep a clear head while handling the situation (like taking a breather or looking at the bigger), but for the most part I think handling the situation with clear communication is ultimately what’s going to help mediate those problems. </p>
