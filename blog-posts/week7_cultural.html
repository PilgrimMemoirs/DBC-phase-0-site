	  <p>In a nutshell, Stereotype Threat is when when a person’s performance is negatively affected due to the idea that they think they are perceived a certain way because of a stereotype.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p><h3>Personal Experiences	  </h3></p>
	  <p> I’m going to put a really weird twist on this topic and stray from the more typical stereotypes mentioned in these studies. While I definitely have experienced some forms of stereotype threat as a blonde, middle-class, female , they’ve been fairly minor compared to the conflicts I’ve experienced as being very short and very young looking - told you, weird twist.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> It may be a stretch from the heavier topics of race, gender and socioeconomic prejudices, but hear me out.  On a very regular basis I am undermined for abilities purely due to the fact that I easily could pass for a middle schooler. This has been most prominent when trying to take on leadership roles and has affected my own personal opinion on if I could ever effectively lead and, in general, be taken seriously.	    </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>It’s not too much of a problem after people get to know me well, they know what I’m capable of and give the proper respect to my abilities. But when it comes to fresh faces who take one look and make the assumption I am young and inexperienced, it becomes frustrating and then the self-doubt kick-in.	    </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I decided to revolve around the topic of looking young instead of the other stereotypes because I believe it is what affects me most when it comes to my academic and professional pursuits. Even in situations where I know I’m the most qualified to lead, I’ll sit back and let someone else do it because I rather not put myself through the stress of not being taken seriously. I know I do psych myself too much out when it comes how I’ll be perceived, even to the point of getting irrationally offended when being offered help.	    </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p><h3>How I plan on handling Stereotype Threat	</h3>  </p>
	  <p> I do feel a bit ridiculous trying to compare this to the internal conflicts minorities go through when in the presence of a situation where stereotype threat is very real, but I believe it plays a large part in why I refuse to judge people before REALLY getting to know them and what they are capable of - especially timid folks. People get nervous, perform more poorly and can lose confidence if they believe others think they aren’t fit to do something. I totally get it, and sadly, physical appearance somehow still plays a large role in how someone is perceived in being suited for something.	    </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I think the best anyone can do is to avoid referencing any sort of stereotype in an academic or professional workplace. Even if it is meant to be perceived as a compliment, it creates an unnecessary pressure to prove themselves and to push themselves as far away as possible from that stereotype. It’s a distraction that can be avoided if we chose to focus on what strengths and weakness the person has as an individual rather than a stereotype we unfairly chose to associate them with. 
	    
	    It was really nice to read about stereotype threat and become more aware of why this happens and what can be done to prevent it. I do think it is something where people don’t realize they’re doing or the negative consequences that can come out of it. That being said, if I’m ever in a situation where I feel I’m being stereotyped, acknowledging what the offender is doing to them and stating why it’s inappropriate while remaining level-headed and non-accusational is going to be my best initial approach.	    </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Unfortunately, a lot of seemingly small social-issues of this sort get overlooked in favor of the “bigger issues” out there, but I think even brief exposure to this topic in schools and workplaces could potentially create a more welcoming and diverse environment. Awareness goes a long way.	    </p>
