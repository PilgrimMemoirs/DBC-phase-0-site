        	While I was disappointed to not see Sereef perched on a leather chair, next to a fireplace with view of taxidermied animals, getting to hear from DBC’s main man was a real treat. Dev Bootcamp is an unconventional learning environment and it was interesting to learn it’s roots. It would have taken a lot more to convince me to join the first course!  </p>

<p> Shereef admits the first go at DBC was rough, but he mentioned a really great metaphor that explained why the course has now evolved into it’s present state and will always be evolving. It is all in the mindset of the student, whether they come in as consumer or a creator.  </p>

<p>
<strong>The Restaurant vs the Kitchen </strong><br>
Sure, we’re all throwing in a lot of dollars to attend DBC, but Shereef makes a good point in that we shouldn’t see our experience as if we are in a restaurant where we have an expectation that we’re entitled to a set standard. Instead, he encourages boots to be part of the bigger picture, as if we are all in it together, working in a kitchen. Something goes awry, fixed it. Don’t complain and demand something better. Be part of the solution. </p>

<p>	This is important in a lot of ways, but mostly because I think it will bring a more positive, welcoming and team oriented atmosphere. I really look forward to the weeks coming and feel more relieved about potentially not knowing as much as my peers! </p>
