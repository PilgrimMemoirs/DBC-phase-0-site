	  <h3 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Research your question first</strong></h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021"> Chances are, somebody&rsquo;s already run into the same problem as you and there is already an answer out there. First and foremost, &nbsp;make sure sure you&rsquo;ve actually experiment and tried different strategies. Then check out Google, forum archives, manuals, FAQ&rsquo;s, and the source code. They can be great initial resources before even needing to ask.</strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <h3 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">No Luck in the Search?</strong></h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021"> Shucks, Then ask away! Before settling for any old forum, make sure you&rsquo;re in an appropriate one for your question. Not only will it give you better chances of getting the answer you&rsquo;re looking for, but it will also piss off less people who get easily bothered by that sort of thing. Some people are very passionate about the organization of online forms, avoid their passive aggressive behavior by just going to the right one. </strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <h3 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Aaand now you can ask</strong></h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Before word vomiting all over the form, take the time to actually plan and structure the question so that potential answer-ers actually know what the eff you&rsquo;re talking about and can also provide you with the best and most specific solution. </strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Start with a specific, but condensed version of your question for the title. Being too vague or unclear can get your question overlooked very easily. No bueno. Then there is the actual question itself..</strong></p>

	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021"> I&rsquo;ve taken the following list straight from here(<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a>) since I couldn&rsquo;t have explained it better:</strong></p>

      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">Be precise and informative about your problem</strong>      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.</strong>      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: &ldquo;Fedora Core 7&rdquo;, &ldquo;Slackware 9.1&rdquo;, etc.).</strong>      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.</strong>      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.</strong>      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.</strong>      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021" dir="ltr">If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.</strong><br>

      <h3 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Other Hot Tips</strong></h3>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Remember, your question is potentially going to be searched and viewed by many. Polish it up and make it read well. </strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">You should almost always include some sort of code, but make sure to only make it a snippet or specify what lines you&rsquo;re having trouble with. </strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">Don&rsquo;t be a spaz. Using things like &lsquo;HELP!!!&rsquo;, &lsquo;Urgent&rsquo;, &lsquo;Can you help me?&rsquo;, ect. are actually more likely to get you an answer you&rsquo;re not looking forâ€¦ if you want to learn from the pro&rsquo;s, act like one. (That means checking your grammar and spelling as well)</strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">If an answer doesn&rsquo;t make sense, go through the same steps (testing &amp; researching) before asking for clarification. </strong></p>

	  <h3 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">----------------------</strong></h3>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-09f353f0-3566-745c-0cae-c938fac9c021">I got ahead of myself and starting writing this post about how to ask good questions, doesn&rsquo;t hurt I suppose. Anyway I&rsquo;ve definitely been guilty of asking very basic and vague questions - especially while working with someone in person - I&rsquo;m probably the worst offender for the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it&rdquo; statement. If it&rsquo;s not obvious about what I&rsquo;m talking about I&rsquo;m usually pretty good about clarifying.</strong></p>
	  <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
	  <p dir="ltr">So far I haven&rsquo;t had many questions that I couldn&rsquo;t find with a google search, and, in most situation, I prefer to search before having to ask as is. When I have asked questions it&rsquo;s generally been in a casual environment where I haven&rsquo;t had to be too formal about how I asked. <br>
	    <br>
	    This sort of formal question asking will be good to know as I get more advanced and start working professionally. Definitely something to start practicing at DBC.	</p>
