Conflicts are bound to happen and when they do, there are right and wrong ways to approach resolving the situation. </strong></p>
<br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23f1-0b5f-6ede-a70c83be75e7">The wrong ways can be best exhibited on the compass of shame with four shameful directions you best avoid when dealing with difficult situations. At the north is withdrawl, East is attack self, south being avoidance and west being attacking others. </strong></p>

	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23f1-0b5f-6ede-a70c83be75e7">Maaannnny years ago, &nbsp;I took an easy, summer, minimum wage job that I obviously didn&rsquo;t take too seriously. The management was poor, and I knew that going in but decided I could put up with it for a few months until I moved back overseas. I was able to brush off most of the conflicts until one that made me snap- I worked overtime and they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t do overtime&rdquo; so they weren&rsquo;t going to pay me for those extra hours. I basically went straight into attack mode, insulting their lack of management and threatening to report them. This of course spiraled downward into a whole deal where I was taken off the schedule until they could have a meeting about my attitude and I told them to not bother and insulted them more. It was bad. Looking back, I am incredibly embarrassed about my attitude and know I could have handled it much better.</strong></p>

	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23f1-0b5f-6ede-a70c83be75e7">A lot of what they were doing was definitely wrong, I still stand by that. But Instead of keeping my cool and admitting my ignorance to their &ldquo;no overtime&rdquo; rule, and addressing why what they were doing was definitely illegal - I went straight into attacking. When has that ever resolved anything effectively? Probably never, and definitely not in this case. I&rsquo;m sure I could also have addressed the other, earlier conflicts before letting them fester and build-up before this event. </strong></p>

	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23f1-0b5f-6ede-a70c83be75e7">Since then, I have run into a couple similiar difficult situations with jobs that I&rsquo;ve been able to handle much better. I know mistakes happen or that owning a business can be complicated- whatever. But I remain very level headed, addressed the issue to them, giving them time before needing to take firmer action. I really prefer to work with them to resolve the problem as best as I can, but ensuring that problem does definitely get resolved.</strong></p>
