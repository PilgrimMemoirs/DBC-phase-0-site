		<h3>Using my Gregorc Thinking Style to asses the best approach for learning while enrolled at Dev Bootcamp.</h3><br><br>
        <p>
As a concrete random mind type, my DBC experience thus far has benefited most from my trial-and-error experiments with coding. Like the profile for CR (concrete randoms) suggests, I often skip steps, jump around or can’t resist the urge to look at the final result and work my way backwards. It really is the way that keeps me most focused and working on a problem - I like being able to see the end result of what I’m doing along with seeing other similar examples. <br><br>

The downside is that it often takes me longer to work on a challenge than it should. I feel I learn a lot, but with the limited time I have to complete all the challenges while also working a full-time job, it definitely isn’t the most efficient approach. So far,  whatever challenges have interested me the most have taken majority of my attention while the others get done sloppily at the last minute. <br><br>

A technique for me to implement for the remaining 16 weeks of DBC, and probably even for post-DBC life, is to scan over readings and tutorials before doing them. Giving myself designated time to jump around and take notes. After reviewing the information, I then follow the instructions exactly in the instructed order. Afterwards I can look for other examples if time allows.<br> <br>

By preparing myself better before starting a tutorial or coding exercise, I will be taking away the temptation of jumping around multiple tutorials and examples, especially if I’m worried about not doing something right. When I’m finished I will compare my work to others and make notes and/or adjustments if I find a technique that is better than what I did - time allowing of course. <br><br>

I think it is good for me to keep in mind that all work completed well is better than half done perfectly and the other half done sloppily. The approach I mentioned above will hopefully keep me on track and focused to do just that.
