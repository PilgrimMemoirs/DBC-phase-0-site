	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23e9-6357-cbc4-6cd5bb888588">After getting cozy with Ruby, it&rsquo;s safe to assume that I&rsquo;ll start building apps. Initially, a lot of those apps are going to be from scratch. As with writing anything, starting with a blank screen can not only be intimidating but also tedious if there is a series of structural code that is almost always going to be present in every project. That is where a solid framework like Rails comes in.</strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23e9-6357-cbc4-6cd5bb888588">Released in 2004 as open source framework, a year after it&rsquo;s creation, developers have latched on to Ruby on Rails (or simply Rails if you&rsquo;re cool) for it&rsquo;s ease of use by speeding development and remaining easy to maintain. As a framework, it contains a set of code libraries and data-structures that provide generic functionality. Those functions emphasize DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) and COC (Convention over Configuration) principals and can be used, overridden or further specialized as needed. </strong></p>
	  <br>
	  <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-299c7e93-23e9-6357-cbc4-6cd5bb888588">With that being said, jumping straight to using Rails without developing from scratch first is very tempting. However, the framework should only be used by experienced developers who already have developing &nbsp;experience, especially with databases, and are familiar with the best practices, standards and security.</strong></p>
	  <p dir="ltr">	  <br>
	    While I am excited to learn and utilized Rails, I understand the importance of getting a firm understanding of developing with Ruby from the bottom-up before doing so. The Lynda.com course I started watching made a really great analogy to help explain the importance of getting solid development experience (with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, ect and most importantly, Ruby) before using Rails; It&rsquo;s like traveling to a foriegn country where you don&rsquo;t know the language, you may not need to know the language while you&rsquo;re only visiting but if you plan on living there you&rsquo;ll need to in order to best understand what&rsquo;s really going on around you.	  </p>
