	  <p> Working with other brilliant minds was a big selling point in investing in a coding course like DBC. This sort of collaboration with a wide spectrum of other peers is such an invaluable experience. The great thing about learning code is that you don’t necessarily need to go to school or even attend a course like this to learn it and get a job, but for me, personally, I couldn’t imagine having a very confident start as a developer without this network. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>As DBC students (or Boots as they call us), We are expected to at least twice a week as we complete our 9-week, off-site, prep phase. Halfway through this initial phase, I can definitely see the reason why DBC is insistent on pairing. Even if you prefer to program on your own, there is no doubt that if you want to be a successful developer you’ll have to work with others. Getting the practice in this early on, especially when not as familiar with code, has expedited my learning and armed me with stronger code vocabulary.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Knowing that I have to work with other people on a challenge forces me to review the material more thoroughly so I have an easier time explaining my thoughts during our pairing session. The times I’ve gone in with barely even looking at the challenge really restricted my ability to explain my thoughts or to contribute much. Coding is very new to me, and while I start understand different concepts, pairing provides the push I need to solidify those concepts. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> On top of pairing we are expected to provide feedback after every session. While reviewing, it is often a good time for me to reflect how I feel the session went and what could have been better. So far I have had very few suggestions to give my pairs and want to get better and providing those. I know I have received some good pointers in my feedback and wouldn’t mind receiving more. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Overall, the pair experience has been going very well! There are a few technical 
	    issues every so often that can be disruptive to an otherwise good pairing session but my pairs and myself have been able to work around it. While these sessions are great prep, they can be limiting with being done online and while most of us still have other commitments outside of DBC. I am definitely looking forward to the onsite portion where longer and more engaging collaboration will happen! </p>
