		<h3> Evaluating My 3 Favorite Sites</h3><br><br>
        <p>
        <p>
        	<strong>1. Bloglovin.com</strong><br><br>
Organized  |  Clean  |  Simple   |   Blog Post Focused  |   Community<br><br>

<p>This is a site I can get lost in for hours! It is a hub for all the best blogs I can personally curate on the web, meaning how I’m greeted when I log into this site is totally up to me. The second the page loads I know exactly which favorite blog of mine just posted. </p><br>

<p>It’s an easy and organized way of staying up to date on my favorite blogs, but it doesn’t stop there. Look up at the simple nav and I’m a click away from discovering other great bloggers and the most popular posts at the moment. </p><br>

<p>It’s almost dangerous to log onto this site because of how easy it is to keep on viewing new content. Even though most of the content is off-site, a Bloglovin nav will still display on external sites if clicked-on via Bloglovin. </p><br><br>

	<p><strong>2. Lynda.com</strong><br><br>
Overwhelming  |  Info heavy  |  Vanilla  |  Subscriber focused  |  Crowded</p><br>

<p>I bought an annual subscription to Lynda.com because of the wide selection of professional video tutorials they offer. They offer so many that it can actually be very overwhelming while navigating the site. <p><br>

<p>During actual video tutorials everything is well organized, but searching can be a pain. Fortunately they do let subscribers make personalized lists that help with keeping track of the tutorials. Without that feature I’d be lost when searching for the next one to watch. </p><br><br>


<p><strong>3. Grooveshark.com</strong><br><br>
Busy  |   Ad focused  |  Personal  |   Interactive  |  Modern </p><br>

<p>The great thing about this site; free music (kind of). The worst park; you really can’t escape their ads without buying a subscription. The site would be pretty simple, modern and well organized without the distracting, large graphics of the ads otherwise. </p><br>

<p>Navigate from the homepage and it gets better, simpler and more personalized. It has very nice drag and drop features that make it feel modern and easy to use. Feels more like I’m using a program than a website.  </p><br>
