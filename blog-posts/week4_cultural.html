	  <h3> I got 99 problems but a glitch ain't one.</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> From breaches in customersâ€™ credit card information to major government website roll-out crashes, we hear about high-profile glitches all too often. Developers have a responsibility, especially when security is involved or the site is heavily relied on.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Much like most jobs, there are deadlines. And when deadlines sneak-up, the temptation to cut corners arises. The only problem with cutting corners as a developer is that a lot can go wrong very quickly. One quick change can have huge, detrimental effects on the rest of the site. Not thoroughly testing can make glitches that otherwise could be easily corrected go unnoticed.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p> Some ways to best avoid and detect glitches before problems happen is to have clear communication with clients as what needs to be done and on a set time-line. The timeline should be thoroughly planned out by the developer and include intensive testing. And of course, always plan for something to go wrong and have a clear back-up plan. </p>
